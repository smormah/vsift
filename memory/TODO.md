# VSift project work record

## Current checkpoint

2026-09-11: P03 / issue #6 is active at its ADR 0006 feasibility gate on
`codex/p03-storage-feasibility`, starting from clean protected main
`25c3aad01fc9e2fc391c5c016295df5aff61fbdd`. P01/P02 are complete; P02 implementation
is `4e9ef08df1e53019df7645edb0e493628a3e401a`.

## Pending

- Prove P03 handle-relative containment, stable locks and publication/flush behavior
  before expanding the filesystem adapter; record any failed feasibility gate.
- FS-01: OS/storage crash qualification is missing. The default cap-std NTFS
  read-only directory handle fails synchronization; a safe writable-directory
  handle succeeds. Do not misreport this as Windows durability being impossible.
  Production expansion remains gated. Review `docs/planning/p03-storage-feasibility.md`
  and proposed ADR 0010; supply disposable native fault environments or accept a
  narrower qualification plan before resuming.
- Resolve baseline findings B-01..B-11 through their mapped implementation packets.
- P03 spike implementation: `5f15c7730607570663d739b7a4dd70a03947e500`, PR #24.
  Local Windows validation: 92 tests, fmt, strict clippy, governance and rustdoc pass.
  Security review enabled cargo-deny's development licence/duplicate checks and
  recorded the existing borrow-or-share MIT-0 licence review. Native CI evidence
  and the unresolved OS/storage crash gate belong in the P03 feasibility record.
- Preserve optional SQLite indexing, enrichment and reconstruction as later packets
  P15..P20 unless scope is explicitly changed.

## Completed

- 2026-09-09: foundation and GitHub governance published in `5289a2b`; support channel
  update in `d7a459e`.
- 2026-09-09: setup command rename merged through PR #1 as `df85f70`.
- 2026-09-09: source review of `df85f70` and comprehensive implementation proposal
  merged through PR #2 as `e3f8569`. It adds no runtime implementation.
- 2026-09-10: P00 merged through PR #18 as `924f6c5`. It accepted DEC-01..13,
  established milestone 1 and issues #3-#17, froze F01-F12 declarative fixture truth,
  and added a machine-validated ledger plus a required protected-branch Governance
  check. All PR checks passed; the workspace had 13 passing tests.
- 2026-09-10: P01 merged through PR #20 as `3d7a7d2`. It published the typed
  R0 CLI/config/JSON boundary, four v1 schemas, domain value contracts, stable
  errors/exits, bounded presentation and C-01..C-10 coverage. All protected checks
  passed across Ubuntu, Windows and macOS; the local workspace had 64 passing tests.
- 2026-09-11: P02 merged through PR #22 as `4e9ef08`. It added canonical provider
  resolution, shell-free process supervision, bounded concurrent pipes, one operation
  deadline, sticky cancellation, Windows Job Object/Unix process-group cleanup, and
  honest strict-isolation reporting. P-01..P-08 and C-05 passed across protected
  three-OS and strict Linux checks; the local Windows workspace had 82 passing tests.
